# Census_API_Testing
This test script needs 2 libraries to run properly: Pytest and Requests library. 
The test script returns a list of users (the amount of users determined by the "results" payload in the "https://randomuser.me/api?results=100" link.
*The values returned will be based on the amount specified in the "results" and not in the "top" parameter given.
The test is passed if the response from server is 200 OK.
